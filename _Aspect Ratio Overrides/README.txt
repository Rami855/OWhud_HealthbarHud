Warning:
The healthbar and its background might still be a bit off on certain resolutions for now.

 Instructions:
1. Pick the folder for your aspect ratio of choice
2. Open it and copy everything inside it to the main hud folder
3. Let it override everything
4. Restart your game or do "hud_reloadscheme" in the console (highly suggest that you restart to avoid issues)

Note: the 1280x1024 one might work for all 5x4 resolutions.
