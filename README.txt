Hud made by a horse
keep in mind this will effectively remove the match hud

Instructions:
	1. Place this folder in your game's custom folder
	2. Make sure you don't have any other hud files, they could conflict
	3. If you're not playing on 16:10 resolution, open the "_Aspect Ratio Overrides" folder and follow instructions
	4. Make sure tf_use_match_hud is set to 1. The mod already enables it on its own but keep it in mind
